If, else & elseif is commonly used to determine if 2 values meet the given requirements.
For example, if variable $x is equals to 10 or if variable $x is 10 and $y is 20.  

###### Exercise 1

Given variables (int) 10, string "10" determine if they both are the same.

###### Exercise 2

Given variable (int) 50, determine if its in the range of 1 and 100.

###### Exercise 3

Given variables (string) "hello" create a condition that if the given value is "hello" then output "world".

###### Exercise 4

By your choice, create condition with 3 checks.  
For example, if value is greater than X, less than Y and is an even number.

###### Exercise 5

Given variable (int) 50 create a condition that prints out "correct" if the variable is inside the range.  
Range should be stored within the 2 separated variables $y and $z.

###### Exercise 6

Create a variable $plateNumber that stores your car plate number.
Create a switch statement that prints out that its your car in case of your number.

###### Exercise 7

Create a variable $number with integer by your choice.
Create a switch statement that prints out text "low" if the value is under 50,
"medium" if the case is higher than 50 but lower than 100, "high" if the value is >100.
